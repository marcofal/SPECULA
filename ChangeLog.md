# SPECULA Changelog


## [Next version]

### New processing and data objects

- Added IntValue, FloatValue and StringValue as specialized containers for scalars and strings, to be used in place of BaseValue where needed.
- Added DisplayRecorder processing object
- Added Phasescreen data object.
- Added Phase Extractor processing object.
- Added CLOSE gain optimizer processing object.

### Interface changes

- Removed simul\_params argument from IirFilter, Integrator and other related processing objects
- Outputs for SpeculaInput and derived objects like TerminalInput must be typed with :int, :float or :str
- Added "window" and "subplot" arguments to all displays to enable multi-plot windows
- Renamed MmsePistonUnwrapper to SoftLimiter and moved the module to specula.processing_objects.soft_limiter
- Added stroke thresholding for dm class
- Added open\_loop\_estimate parameter to OpticalGainEstimator.
- Enabled start and end time (start\_time and end\_time parameters) in FieldAnalyser.
- Added "out_window_id" output to all displays to support video recording
- Added "beam_center" for uplink beam in pixel. Used for Fresnel propagation to indicate if beam is not located in the center.

### Other

- Fixed BaseOperation using stale/uninitialized input values when in\_value1 or in\_value2 had never been generated
- Fixed vecWeiPixRadT extraction in ShSlopec
- Fixed output\_names in PhaseScreenCube
- Fixed PhaseScreenCube crash on GPU due to np.searchsorted called on a cupy array
- Fixed start\_time bug in WindowedIntegration
- Optimization of the compute\_ifs\_covmat function
- Added Fraunhofer far field propagation
- ...
